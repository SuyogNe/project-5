            According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne,
             referred to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by Ne,
              the country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl. According to Nepāl Mahātmya,
              Nemi was charged with protection of the country by Pashupati. According to Buddhist mythology,
               Manjushri Bodhisattva drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed
                that Adi-Buddha Ne would take care of the community that would settle it. As the cherished of Ne,
                 the valley would be called Nepāl. According to Gopalarājvamshāvali, the genealogy of ancient
                  Gopala dynasty compiled .In the 1380s, Nepal is named after Nepa the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali
                   scion of the Abhiras.
